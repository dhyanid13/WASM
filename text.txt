High-Level Steps for a Conceptual Filter
Extract JWT from the HTTP Request:

Parse incoming HTTP request headers to extract the JWT, typically from the Authorization header.
Fetch JWKS from the External Source:

Make an HTTP request to the JWKS endpoint (e.g., login.microsoftonline.com) to fetch the JWKS. This requires your Envoy environment to allow outbound HTTP requests from WASM filters.
Parse the JWKS and Extract the Public Key:

Parse the JWKS response to extract the public keys. This step would involve JSON parsing.
Validate the JWT:

Decode the JWT (without verifying its signature) to extract the header and payload.
Validate the JWT's claims according to your application's requirements (e.g., issuer, audience, and expiration).
Ideally, verify the JWT's signature using one of the public keys from the JWKS. This step is crucial for security but also the most challenging to implement within a WASM filter due to the reasons mentioned earlier.

Cryptographic Operations: As previously mentioned, performing cryptographic operations for JWT signature verification is complex within the TinyGo environment due to limited library support.
